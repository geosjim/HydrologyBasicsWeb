# Runoff Coefficients

The rational method uses a runoff coefficient to separate the rainfall depth into losses and runoff. It defines a simple
percentage for the amount of rainfall that runs off. The rational equation is given as:

Q = CiA

where:  C = runoff coefficient (a value between 0.0 and 1.0)
i = rainfall intensity (inches/hour)
A = area (acres)

If C represents the percentage of rainfall that becomes runoff then (1-C) would be the losses. In the case of runoff
coefficients all losses, including initial abstractions and infiltration are accounted for with this single value.

Some examples of different C values for different kinds of surface condition are given in the following table.
Surface condition Runoff Coefficient
Business districts 0.70 - 0.95
Residential 0.50 - 0.75
Industrial 0.50 - 0.90
Parks and grass 0.05 - 0.30
Streets and driveways 0.75 - 0.95
Agricultural and unimproved 0.10 - 0.30

If a watershed contains multiple surface conditions, a composite runoff coefficient should be calculated using an area
weighted average.
