# Routing

When it is necessary to subdivide a watershed in order to design a detention facility, a culvert or other hydraulic
structure, or simply because the parameters of the hydrologic model like rainfall or curve number change in space, then
the runoff hydrograph must be routed in order to account for the effects of travel through the storage basin or river
reach.

There are two types of routing that will be presented in this section. Storage routing through a detention basin, or
behind an embankment where a culvert might be present, and river routing through a natural channel reach.
