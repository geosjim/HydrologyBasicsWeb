# Storage Outflow

While the storage capacity curve is used to define the relationship between volume and elevation, a rating curve that
defines the elevation vs. discharge is required in order to determine the outflow from the storage basin. Generally
discharge is controlled by low level outlets and spillways. Culverts and other pipe openings are typically used for low
level outlets. Spillways are part of any dam construction, but in the case of a roadway or other similar embankment that
may cause flood waters to be temporarily stored, the roadway itself acts as a spillway once the water surface elevation
reaches the top.

Rating curves for hydraulic control structures like culverts and spillways can be computed from simplified equations
such as the orifice and weir equations. More sophisticated programs such as HY8 or HEC-RAS can also be used to generate
rating curves where inlet and outlet losses and improved structures are considered. Such rating curves can be exported
for use in detention basin analysis.
