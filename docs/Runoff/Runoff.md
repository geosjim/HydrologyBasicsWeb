# Basin Runoff

Once losses have been computed the remaining precipitation, referred to as effective precipitation must be converted to
runoff. After the initial abstractions and infiltration capacity are reached the precipitation excess (in this example 1
inch) would be left standing if the watershed were exactly flat. The volume is easily computed as the effective
precipitation depth times the area of the watershed.

However, watersheds are not flat and so the effective precipitation will run off.
