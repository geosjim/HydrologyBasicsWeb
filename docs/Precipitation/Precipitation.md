# Precipitation

For deterministic models the precipitation input is the primary catalyst for generating the peak flow and runoff
hydrograph. For models like HEC-HMS precipitation is defined as a rainfall depth and temporal distribution (time varying
intensity), whereas other models like the rational formula use a constant rainfall intensity.
