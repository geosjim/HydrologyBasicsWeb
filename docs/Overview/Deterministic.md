# Deterministic

A deterministic model uses physical characteristics and numerical representations of physical processes like rainfall,
infiltration, runoff, and detention basin and river routing to estimate peak flows. The driving force behind a
deterministic model is the rainfall depth and rate (intensity).

The rational method and HEC-HMS are two common deterministic models that will be used to describe these
processes. Most other numerical models are similar in nature to the methods used by these two.
